Discount Calculator
This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The script defines a function called calculate_discount that takes two parameters: `price` and `discount_percent`. If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, the function calculates the final price by subtracting the discount amount from the original price. If the `discount percentage` is less than 20%, the function returns the original price as the final price.
